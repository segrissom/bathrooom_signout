Developing an app to automate high school classroom bathroom signout

Purpose: Overall I'm just tired of the process of signout. I don't typically use my laptop while teaching/working with students due to the nature of my room's equipment and materials, along with course topics. Students are generally ignoring my current rules, because of the time it takes for me to sit and read the bathroom signout log and then follow up with students who are 'abusing'. I would like students to become 'flagged' based on time out of the room, along with potentially frequency and length (presuming no pre-existing health conditions). 

Goals: I am going to essentially create a database, where there are select values that students can input (aka their name, potentially their ID number, etc) and it'll automatically generate date, time logging out, and that it will hold the screen frozen until they return and interact with it. This will also help prevent too many students from being out of the room at once. 

My Current Setup: I just made a google sheets document doing this on some level, but I am still going to middle man it until I get something more put into place. I have it programmed appropriately, pulling specific data depending on the class/sheet that is selected. I would like to no longer middle man it though, but with google sheets everyone can technically see everyone else's activity/fuss with it whereas I more or less want it to FREEZE.
